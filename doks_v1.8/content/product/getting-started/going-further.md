## Build Complex and Efficient Data Pipelines

ETLBox is designed to handle more than just basic workflows. Its architecture allows you to create highly **modular, scalable, and reusable pipelines** for even the most demanding data integration tasks. Whether you’re processing massive datasets or orchestrating multi-step transformations, ETLBox ensures efficiency at every step.

### Example: Efficiency with Blocking and Non-Blocking Transformations

ETLBox offers a variety of transformation options, including **blocking** and **non-blocking transformations**, giving you control over how data is processed.

- **Blocking Transformations**: These transformations process all data at once. For example, a sort operation requires the entire dataset to be loaded into memory before outputting sorted results.
- **Non-Blocking Transformations**: These transformations process data row by row, enabling streaming of results. For instance, filtering rows based on a condition is non-blocking.

With these tools, you can fine-tune the behavior of your pipelines to meet your performance and resource requirements.

## Code-First Approach Enables Testable Pipelines

One of the standout advantages of ETLBox is its **code-first design**, which makes your pipelines not only powerful but also **testable**. You can write unit tests for individual tasks or entire pipelines, ensuring reliability and catching issues early in development. This approach integrates seamlessly into your existing CI/CD workflows, making it easier than ever to maintain high-quality data processes.

With ETLBox, you can apply the same rigor to your data pipelines as you do to the rest of your code.

## Connect to Diverse Data Sources

ETLBox supports a wide range of data sources and destinations, including:

- **Relational Databases**: SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and more
- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, CosmosDB
- **File-based Sources**: CSV, JSON, Excel
- **APIs**: Load and transform data from external APIs
- **Polyglot Notebooks**: Use ETLBox in Jupyter or other interactive environments

This flexibility allows you to create pipelines that integrate with diverse systems, making ETLBox suitable for any data scenario.

## Where Can You Use ETLBox?

ETLBox is versatile and can be applied in a variety of scenarios:

- **Data Warehouse (DWH) or Data Lake Loading**: Build pipelines that populate and update your enterprise-scale storage systems with ease.
- **Classic ETL**: Perform traditional extract-transform-load operations with code-first simplicity.
- **General Data Integration**: Connect systems, synchronize data, or integrate with APIs in a maintainable and testable way.
- **Polyglot Notebooks**: Use ETLBox interactively in data science workflows to prototype and visualize pipelines.
