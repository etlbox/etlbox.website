## Perfect fit for Data Integration

ETLBox simplifies integration between disparate systems. It supports a wide range of data sources and formats, allowing you to connect relational databases, NoSQL systems, files, and APIs. This makes it ideal for scenarios such as:

- Synchronizing data between transactional systems and reporting tools
- Consolidating customer information across CRM, ERP, and other platforms
- Connecting on-premises databases with cloud services

## Code-First Simplicity

ETLBox’s code-first approach allows you to define integrations directly in C#, making it easy to adapt workflows to your business needs. Unlike visual ETL tools, it provides full control, enabling you to handle custom logic, transformations, and error handling efficiently.

```csharp
var source = new CsvSource<MyDataRow>("input.csv");
var apiDestination = new RestApiDestination<MyDataRow>("https://api.example.com/upload", ResourceType.Http);
source.LinkTo(apiDestination);
source.Execute();
apiDestination.Wait();
```

This example demonstrates how you can quickly integrate data from a CSV file into a REST API.
