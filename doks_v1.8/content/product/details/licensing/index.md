Choosing between the Company License and the Redistributable License depends on your organization's distribution strategy and control over deployment environments. For internal applications or SaaS solutions where you manage the deployment, the Company License is appropriate. If you're embedding ETLBox into products distributed to customers without direct deployment control, the Redistributable License offers the necessary flexibility and rights.
