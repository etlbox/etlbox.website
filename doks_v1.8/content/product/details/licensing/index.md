## Company License

The Company License is designed for organizations that intend to use ETLBox internally or within applications where they maintain direct control over the deployment environments.

**Key Features:**

- **Per-Developer Licensing:** Licenses are issued on a per-developer basis, allowing each licensed developer to use ETLBox across multiple projects within the company.
- **Annual License Key Renewal:** Each license is valid for one year and requires annual renewal. A new license key is provided upon renewal.
- **Deployment Flexibility:** Suitable for solutions deployed internally, SaaS-based applications, or environments where you have direct access to manage ETLBox deployments.

**Licensing Agreement:**

- Governed by the [Standard End-User License Agreement (EULA)](/pricing/eula/standard-eula/).

**Pricing:**

- Starts at a low fee per developer per year. For detailed pricing, refer to the [ETLBox Pricing Page](https://www.etlbox.net/support/pricing/).

## Redistributable License (OEM License)

The Redistributable License is ideal for organizations that plan to integrate ETLBox into products distributed to external customers, especially when direct access to deployment environments is not feasible.

**Key Features:**

- **Source Code Access:** Provides full access to ETLBox source code, facilitating seamless integration and customization within your products.
- **No License Checks Required:** Allows distribution of ETLBox as part of your product without the need for individual license checks for end-users.
- **White-Labeling:** No obligation to mention ETLBox in your product, enabling a fully branded solution.

**Licensing Agreement:**

- Governed by the [Redistribution End-User License Agreement (EULA)](/pricing/eula/redistribution-eula/).

**Pricing:**

- Consists of an annual base fee plus a per-customer fee, varying based on your expected customer volume. Discounts are available for small companies with annual revenues of less than â‚¬1 million or teams with 1-2 developers. For a personalized quote, please contact ETLBox directly.

Choosing between the Company License and the Redistributable License depends on your organization's distribution strategy and control over deployment environments. For internal applications or SaaS solutions where you manage the deployment, the Company License is appropriate. If you're embedding ETLBox into products distributed to customers without direct deployment control, the Redistributable License offers the necessary flexibility and rights.
