## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is there a trial version?
Absolutely. By downloading the official NuGet package of ETLBox, you can set it up and use it for testing purposes. The connectors are limited to 5,000 rows. For further testing, you can request a trial valid for 45 days. The trial key will remove all limitations, and you can fully evaluate the library. If you need a renewal of the trial period, no problem, just contact us.

#### What if I am not satisfied?
If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, we will refund the full purchase price within 30 days of the purchase date.

#### What about VAT?
All prices are net without VAT or other local taxes that may apply.

#### What if I am not a company?
If you are not a company, please contact us and let us know your country of residence. There will be different pricing (normally the net price plus VAT), depending on your region.

#### Educational, Non-Profit, and Other Licenses
If you are interested in other licensing options, please contact us and describe your specific needs.

#### What if I need to change a subscription?
Not a problem. Just let us know, and we'll create a custom invoice so that you only pay the difference. You'll receive a confirmation email upon purchase which can be used as an invoice/receipt.

#### What does "Chargable option: Source code access" mean?
You can optionally purchase access to the ETLBox source code.

#### What does "Company-wide use" mean?
The standard licenses (Personal Use, Company-Wide Use) allows usage of ETLBox inside your own company only.
Only developers from the registered company may build software or apps on top of ETLBox.
If you plan to distribute ETLBox as part of your products to 3rd parties, please obtain a REDISTRIBUTABLE license.

#### Software as a Service - which license should I choose?
If your SaaS is deployed on servers under your control, you may choose between the Company-Wide Use and Redistributable licenses. Please ask for a quote and provide us with a short description of your setup.

#### What is the REDISTRIBUTABLE license for?
The REDISTRIBUTABLE license lets you use ETLBox in software products you sell or ship to customers. It provides license-check-free packages and source code access, enabling you to integrate ETLBox into your own product for distribution.
