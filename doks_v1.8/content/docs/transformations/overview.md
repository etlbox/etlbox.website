## Transformation Execution Behavior

### Row-by-Row Processing

Most ETLBox transformations operate in a row-by-row fashion. As soon as a row enters a transformationâ€™s input buffer, it is processed and the result is passed to the output. This streaming behavior allows for high-performance data flows and efficient memory usage within batch execution pipelines.

## Non-Blocking vs Blocking

Transformations are categorized based on how they handle input data:

- **Non-blocking** transformations process rows immediately as they arrive, requiring minimal memory.

- **Blocking transformations** wait until all data (or a defined batch) has been received before producing output. These transformations are necessary for operations like sorting, aggregation, or complex joins.

This article provides details about non-blocking transformations. For information on blocking transformations, see [Blocking Transformations Overview](../blocking-transformations/overview).

## Input and Output Buffers

Each transformation has at least one input buffer. Buffers temporarily store rows during processing and ensure smooth data flow between components.

If a transformation receives data faster than it can process, the input buffer absorbs the excess. By default, each buffer allows up to **100,000 rows**.

However, if a buffer fills up and data cannot be processed quickly enough, memory consumption can increase significantly. To avoid high memory usage, it is recommended to lower the buffer size if needed:

```csharp
transformation.MaxBufferSize = 50000; // Per component
Settings.MaxBufferSize = 10000; // Global default
```

## Descriptions

**RowTransformation**: Applies custom C# logic to transform each row. Can also convert input to a different output type.

**CachedRowTransformation**: Similar to RowTransformation, with access to a cache of previously processed rows for comparison or deduplication logic.

**ColumnTransformation**: Changes the structure of the row by renaming, reordering, or removing properties. Always returns a dynamic object.

**FilterTransformation**: Excludes rows that do not satisfy a specified condition.

**Distinct**: Removes duplicate rows by comparing content and allowing only the first occurrence.

**LookupTransformation**: Adds fields to each row by matching values from a preloaded lookup dataset.

**MergeJoin**: Combines rows from two sources using a custom equality function. Works best with pre-sorted inputs.

**Multicast**: Sends identical copies of each row to multiple downstream components.

**RowDuplication**: Creates multiple instances of each row. Can be made conditional using a predicate.

**RowMultiplication**: Converts one input row into multiple output rows using a custom function.

**RowValidation**: Checks rows against defined validation rules and routes valid and invalid rows separately.

**XmlSchemaValidation**: Validates the contents of an XML string field in a row against a given XML Schema Definition (XSD).
