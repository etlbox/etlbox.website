lead: "Use the WaitTransformation when you need to synchronize different parts of a data flow or wait for external tasks to complete before continuing processing. It supports both internal data flow dependencies and external triggers via TaskCompletionSource."

## Overview

The `WaitTransformation` is used to delay the processing of data in a flow until one or more other components or tasks are completed. It acts as a synchronization point and is particularly useful when data from different paths must be coordinated before continuing.

This component is most commonly used when working with **split paths** in a data flow, such as after a [Multicast](../../transformations/multicast) or condition-based routing via [Predicates](/docs/introduction/linking/). It can also be used to wait on one or more external `TaskCompletionSource` instances.

### When to Use

- **Synchronizing split flows**: Wait for a certain path to finish before processing rows from another path.
- **Coordination between flows**: Ensure one component completes before continuing elsewhere.
- **External control**: Block until an external event signals completion via a task.

### Buffering

The `WaitTransformation` uses internal buffers to control data flow:

- **Input buffer**: Accepts records but holds them until the awaited condition is fulfilled.
- **Output buffer**: Starts forwarding data only after waiting has completed.
- **Blocking behavior**: Processing is paused until:
  - All components in `DataFlowComponents` have completed.
  - All tasks in `TaskCompletionSources` are resolved.

## Wait for Other Data Flow Components

You can pass any other data flow component directly to the `WaitTransformation`:

```csharp
var dest = new DbDestination("TableName");
var wait = new WaitTransformation<MyRow>(dest);
```

You can also pass multiple components:

```csharp
var dest1 = new DbDestination("TableName");
var row = new RowTransformation();
var wait = new WaitTransformation<MyLinkingRow>(row, dest);
```

Or set them programmatically:

```csharp
var wait = new WaitTransformation<MyRow>();
wait.DataFlowComponents = new[] { component1, component2 };
```

### Example: Synchronizing Two Networks

This example demonstrates how to coordinate two independent data flows. The `WaitTransformation` ensures that the second network waits until the first network completes before continuing.

```kroki {type=mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme':'neutral'}}%%
flowchart LR
  subgraph Network1
    source1[Source1]
    dest1[Destination1]
    source1 --> dest1
  end

  subgraph Network2
    source2[Source2]
    wait[WaitTransformation-waits for Destination1]
    row[RowTransformation]
    dest2[Destination2]
    source2 --> wait --> row --> dest2
  end

  dest1 --> completion --> wait
```

```csharp
bool completed = false;
MemorySource<MyLinkingRow> source1 = new MemorySource<MyLinkingRow>();
source1.Data = CreateDemoData(1, 200000);

MemorySource<MyLinkingRow> source2 = new MemorySource<MyLinkingRow>();
source2.Data = CreateDemoData(1, 200000);

var dest1 = new MemoryDestination<MyLinkingRow>();
var dest2 = new MemoryDestination<MyLinkingRow>();
var wait = new WaitTransformation<MyLinkingRow>(dest1);
var row = new RowTransformation<MyLinkingRow>();
row.TransformationFunc = row => {
    if (completed == false) throw new Exception("This won't happen");
    return row;
};
dest2.OnCompletion = () => completed = true;

source1.LinkTo(dest1);
source2.LinkTo(wait).LinkTo(row).LinkTo(dest2);

Task t1 = Network.ExecuteAsync(source2);
Task t2 = Network.ExecuteAsync(source1);

Task.WaitAll(t1, t2);
```

### Example: Waiting Within the Same Flow

This example shows how the `WaitTransformation` can be used to pause one branch of a split data flow until another branch completes, ensuring correct execution order within the same network.

```kroki {type=mermaid}
%%{init: {'theme':'neutral'}}%%
flowchart LR
  source1[Source1]
  source2[Source2]
  wait[WaitTransformation - waits for Source2]
  row[RowTransformation]
  dest[Destination]

  source1 --> wait --> row --> dest
  source2 --> row
```

```C#
bool completedSource1 = false;
bool completedSource2 = false;

MemorySource<MyLinkingRow> source1 = new MemorySource<MyLinkingRow>();
source1.Data = CreateDemoData(10001, 11000);

MemorySource<MyLinkingRow> source2 = new MemorySource<MyLinkingRow>();
source2.Data = CreateDemoData(1, 1000);


var row = new RowTransformation<MyLinkingRow>();
var dest = new MemoryDestination<MyLinkingRow>();
var wait = new WaitTransformation<MyLinkingRow>(source2);

row.TransformationFunc = row => {
    if (row.Col1 == 1000)
        completedSource2 = true;
    if (row.Col1 == 11000)
        completedSource1 = true;
    if (!completedSource2 && row.Col1 > 1000)
         throw new Exception("This won't happen");
    return row;
};


//Act
source1.LinkTo(wait).LinkTo(row).LinkTo(dest);
source2.LinkTo(row);

Network.Execute(wait);
```

## Waiting for TaskCompletionSource

You can also wait for one or more external `TaskCompletionSource<bool>` instances.

```csharp
var tcs1 = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();
var tcs2 = new TaskCompletionSource<bool>();

var wait = new WaitTransformation<MyRow>();
wait.TaskCompletionSources = new[] { tcs1, tcs2 };
```

The transformation will start processing only when both tasks are completed.

## Cancellation Support

### Cancelling Execution

ETLBox supports cancellation of running data flows through the use of `CancellationTokenSource`, which can be passed to `Network.ExecuteAsync`.

```csharp
var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
var task = Network.ExecuteAsync(waitComponent, cts.Token);

// Cancel after a timeout or custom logic
cts.Cancel();
```

If cancellation is triggered before the awaited components complete, the `WaitTransformation` and other linked components will stop processing and propagate the cancellation through the pipeline.

### Using `Network.Cancel()`

Alternatively, you can cancel execution explicitly using ETLBoxâ€™s built-in mechanism:

```csharp
Network.Cancel(wait);
```

This cancels the data flow containing the `WaitTransformation`, and if the wait is still in progress, a `TaskCanceledException` will be thrown.
