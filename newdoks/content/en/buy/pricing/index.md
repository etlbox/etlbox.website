If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, we will refund the full purchase price within 30 days of the
purchase date.
   
#### Is there a trial version?

Sure. If you download the official nuget package of ETLBox, you can already set it up and use it for testing purposes. The database and flat file connectors are limited to 10.000 rows. For further testing, you can request a trial valid for 45 days. If you need a renewal of the trial period, no problem, just contact us. 

#### What about VAT?

All prices are net without VAT or other local taxes that may apply. 

#### What if I am not a company?

If you are not a company, please contact us and tell us your country you are residing. There will be different pricing (normally the net price plus VAT), depending on your region. 

#### Educational, Non-Profit and other licenses

If you are interested in other licensing options, please contact us describing your specific needs.
    
#### How many licenses do I need to buy?

Licensing is based on the amount of developers who are working with code that uses ETLBox. No additional licensing is needed. (You can deploy ETLBox on as many servers and virtual machines as you like, independent of the sizing of the usage of the systems).

#### Are there perpetual licenses?

We want to make sure that you always have access to the latest version and features of ETLBox. To guarantee continued support and development, we only offer annual licenses. 

#### What if I need to change a subscription?

Not a problem. Just let us know, and we'll create a custom invoice so that you only pay the difference.
You'll receive a confirmation email upon purchase which can be used as an invoice/receipt.

#### What means company wide use?

The standard licenses (STARTUP, BUSINESS, COMPANY, ENTERPRISE) are targeted to a company wide use. Only users from the registered company may access any software build on top of ETLBox. If you plan to distribute ETLBox as part of your products (either on-premise os as a SaaS solution), please contact us to obtain a REDISTRIBUTABLE license. 

#### Software as a Service - which license to choose?

If you are distributing products based on ETLBox to customers either on-premise or as a SaaS solution, the REDISTRIBUTABLE license is the right choice. 

#### What is the REDISTRIBUTABLE license for?

If you want to use ETLBox in software products or code that you sell or ship to your customers, please choose the Redistributable license. If you are going to deploy or sell your software or ETL code to your customers or other parties, you don't want to have any ETLBox license checks in your shipped product. And most likely you want to hide that you are even using ETLBox. This is the purpose of the Redistributable license - build your own product based on ETLBox, and sell it to your customers as your own software. No backlinking/mentioning/additional licensing/special license handling needed. 

The Redistributable license comes with full source code access - that allows you to have full control over your dependency to ETLBox. 

#### How is the REDISTRIBUTABLE license different from other licenses?

The REDISTRIBUTABLE license comes with a Royality-Free EULA which explicitly allows to redistribute ETLBox as part of your own products.

The use of ETLBox can be hidden for your customers, and no back-linking or mentioning of ETLBox is needed.

For the standard licenses, customer receive a license key to remove any limitations from the currently available nuget package of ETLBox. This license key needs to be renewed every year.

For the redistributable license, you will get access to a nuget package that doesn't have any license checks at all. This nuget package can be used in your code without limitations and without license key.

As part of the redistributable license, you will also get full access to the source code. This source code will be without any license checks in place, and you are free to integrate this your existing code base (e.g. into your CI/CD pipelines)

So when you purchase the redistributable, you can use either the license-free nuget package or the source code to integrate ETLBox in your products, and you are free to redistribute it with your software - doesn't matter if it is on-premise on customer site or in your SaaS products.
