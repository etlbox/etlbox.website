### Frequently asked questions

#### What if I am not satisfied?

If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, we will refund the full purchase price within 30 days of the
purchase date.
   
#### Is there a trial version?

Sure. If you download the official nuget package of ETLBox, you can already set it up and use it for testing purposes. The database and flat file connectors are limited to 10.000 rows. For further testing, you can request a trial valid for 45 days. If you need a renewal of the trial period, no problem, just contact us. 

#### What about VAT?

All prices are net without VAT or other local taxes that may apply. 

#### What if I am not a company?

If you are not a company, please contact us and tell us your country you are residing. There will be different pricing (normally the net price plus VAT), depending on your region. 

#### Educational, Non-Profit and other licenses

If you are interested in other licensing options, please contact us describing your specific needs.
    
### How many licenses do I need to buy?

Licensing is based on the amount of developers who are working with code that uses ETLBox. No additional licensing is needed. (You can deploy ETLBox on as many servers and virtual machines as you like, independent of the sizing of the usage of the systems).

#### Are there perpetual licenses?

We want to make sure that you always have access to the latest version and features of ETLBox. To guarantee continued support and development, we only offer annual licenses. 

#### What if I need to change a subscription?

Not a problem. Just let us know, and we'll create a custom invoice so that you only pay the difference.
You'll receive a confirmation email upon purchase which can be used as an invoice/receipt.

#### What is the redistributable license for?

If you want to use ETLBox in software products or code that you sell or ship to your customers, please choose the Redistributable license. Please contact us if you need an individual offer. 

If you are going to deploy or sell your software or ETL code to your customers or other parties, you don't want to have any ETLBox license checks in your shipped product. And most likely you want to hide that you are even using ETLBox. This is the purpose of the Redistributable license - build your own product based on ETLBox, and sell it to your customers as your own software. No backlinking/mentioning/additional licensing/special license handling needed. 

The Redistributable license comes with full source code access - that allows you to have full control over your dependency to ETLBox.
